<Content title="about me" hideTitle>
	<h1>hello.</h1>
	<p>
		I'm Pavel Zolotarevskiy, a developer from Moscow, Russia, currently studying
		in Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Online I go by flexagoon, or
		fxgn for short.<Sidenote>
			<a href="/brand">Don't you dare</a> spell it any other way.
		</Sidenote> I'm interested in many aspects of full-stack software development,
		however, I'm mostly known for not having any meritable projects in any of them.<Sidenote
		>
			Maybe I'm too harsh on myself, as I do have a few fun pet projects (see
			below). But I don't consider any of them complex enough to be
			praise-worthy.
		</Sidenote>
	</p>

	<p>
		Once in a while I'm struck by the blessing of hyperfocus, which grants me
		the ability to work on a single project for about 5 days before I get bored
		again. Sometimes I even manage to finish a small project in those few days.
		Other times I don't, and I have to begrudgingly add the task to my to-do
		list and get sad every time I look at it.<Sidenote>
			I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> to
			feel productive. I don't know if it actually helps me get anything done (as
			the name claims), but it does help me avoid constant anxiety.
		</Sidenote> Here are some of the most interesting projects that I managed to
		complete without abandoning:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/flexagoon/ream">ream</a> is 1:1 standalone re-implementation
			of Telegram's export functionality. This project was fun to write because it
			required me to sift through Telegram's messy C++ code and figure out what's
			going on. It was also <strong>NOT</strong> fun to write because I, for some
			reason, decided to write it in Python.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/flexagoon/automenu">automenu</a> is a script I
			wrote for myself to parse my school cafeteria menu and generate a meal plan
			for me using linear optimization. I no longer use this since I no longer go
			to school, but this was something I enjoyed making.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners"
				>RWC reborn</a
			> is a GNOME extension that adds rounded corners to windows. It is technically
			a fork of the original RWC extension, but most of the code is rewritten from
			scratch since the old code was terrible. I hated working on this, but hey,
			at least it helped me learn a lot about GNOME.<Sidenote
				>Mainly that GNOME's documentation is absolutely awful and you
				practically can't write an extension without a lot of tribal knowledge.
			</Sidenote>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/flexagoon/med">med?</a> is a web tool that accepts
			a name of a medicine and automatically checks the number of research on it,
			also generating a summary of the research using Claude API. I decided to write
			this project because medicine in Russia is basically unregulated. I'm writing
			it in Elixir, so I don't hate it.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>this…</h2>
	<p>
		This website is <a href="https://github.com/flexagoon/fxgn.dev"
			>a codebase</a
		> I work on to relax; a zen garden of sorts. I don't know what it is about front-end
		development, but for some reason it's an area that I would never want to work
		in, but really enjoy toying around with.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've re-written this site about 4 times in different stacks, and finally
		settled on <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, which is absolutely
		fantastic. I've also tried multiple different designs before making this
		monochrome version. The current design is somewhat inspired by <a
			href="https://gwern.net">Gwern</a
		>, and is essentially trying to be "Gwern but sans-serif".<Sidenote>
			You can see the similarities on the desktop version of this site, with the
			sidenotes and stuff.
		</Sidenote>
		I'm not sure if it's succeeding, since the biggest part of Gwern's brand is the
		sheer volume of content on his site, and I can't write this much because I'm
		too busy worrying about all of the other stuff I could be doing right now.
	</p>
	<h2>…and that</h2>
	<p>
		Despite this page inadvertently sounding like a lament of a sad lonely
		programmer, I'm actually not like that in real life. My personal life
		details are probably too private to be put on a public CC0-licensed website,
		but I'm generally a very happy and extraverted person. As a proof that I
		have real friends, <a href="https://site.ultrageopro.ru"
			>here's a website of one of them</a
		>. I forced him to learn Astro just for that, so I hope you enjoy it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I enjoy many things outside of programming.<Sidenote>
			Perhaps too many. I hate the phrase "jack of all trades, master of none",
			because of how accurately it describes me.
		</Sidenote> My biggest interests include economics, philosophy, some branches
		of biology/chemistry, fun branches of mathematics like formal logic,<Sidenote
		>
			"Fun" usually means "elegant and with a lot of fancy symbols".
		</Sidenote> and having a lot of overly nuanced opinions no one cares about. Maybe
		someday I'll put some of those opinions in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, that
		way at least Googlebot will read them.
